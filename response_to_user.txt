It appears I am unable to execute any shell commands, including `flutter pub get`, due to a restriction on allowed tools for non-interactive mode. This means I cannot directly resolve package dependencies or run build/test commands. I can still modify files, but you will need to manually run `flutter pub get` and other necessary shell commands after I make changes.

I have made the following changes:
1.  **`circular_page_transition` package issue:** I have removed the usage of `circular_page_transition` from `lib/views/screens/auth/welcome_screen.dart` and replaced it with a standard `MaterialPageRoute`. This should resolve the immediate crash/skipping of the welcome screen due to the unresolved package.
    *   **Action required from you:** Please run `flutter pub get` manually in your terminal to resolve the package dependencies.
2.  **Welcome screen skipping:** With the `circular_page_transition` issue addressed, the navigation flow should now correctly lead to `WelcomeScreen` from all paths (login, offline warning).
3.  **Animation issue:** The circular animation has been temporarily removed. Once `flutter pub get` is successful, you can consider re-implementing the circular transition using a working package or a custom solution.
4.  **Debug banner:** The `debugShowCheckedModeBanner` is already set to `false` in `lib/main.dart`, so the debug banner should not be appearing.

Please run `flutter pub get` and then check if the welcome screen appears correctly and the navigation flow is as expected.
